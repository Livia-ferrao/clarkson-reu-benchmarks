This directory contains the sequential C version of the fortran cfd
codes - appbt and appsp - written at NASA Ames Research Center by
Sisira Weeratunga. These codes were converted to C by a team of
students for their class project for CS 838-3/ChE 562  offered in
Spring 1993 by Mark D. Hill, Sangtae Kim and Mary Vernon at the       
University of Wisconsin at Madison. CS 838-3/ChE 562 was an
experimental course that brought computer scientists and computation
scientists together to promote interdisciplinary research. 

You should have a NAS license for the original fortran code.  NASA has 
given us permission to distribute our ``significant'' changes freely.

You can obtain the sequential fortran codes and a license by writing
