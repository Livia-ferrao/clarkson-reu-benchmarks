The maximum problem bounds are specified in appbt.h as S1, S2, and S3. 
This statically allocates large data structures and should be as small as 
possible while still being greater than or equal to the dimensions of the
grid in your largest run.

The program only verifies input data sets of 12^3 and 64^3 sizes with 
pre-defined input data files; any other sizes will cause a verification
failure (but may still produce the correct results).

To run one of the predefined input sizes, ensure that the S[123] constants
in appbt.h are sufficiently large, and set the INPUT_SIZE environment variable
in the provided Makefile to the desired size.  Doing a make will set up the
appropriate input and output files.  Then run the application with no
command line arguments.  The output of the run will go to stdout and can
be compared against the file 'appbt.output'.
