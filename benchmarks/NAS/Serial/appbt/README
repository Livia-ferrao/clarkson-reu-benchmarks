This is the C version of the Fortran code developed at NASA Ames Research
Center.  We converted the code to C as a part of our class project for
CS 838-3/ChE 562  offered in Spring 1993 by Mark D. Hill, Sangtae Kim and
Mary Vernon at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.  CS 838-3/ChE 562
was an experimental course that brought computer scientists and computation
scientists together to promote interdisciplinary research.

You should have a NAS license for the original fortran code.  NASA has
